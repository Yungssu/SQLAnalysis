## üß†Project Overview
This project involved building a **Power BI dashboard** for AtliQ Hardware, aimed at enhancing the company's ability to track and analyze real-time sales data. Using a combination of **SQL queries** for data extraction and **Power BI** for visualization, the goal was to provide actionable business insights for the sales and marketing teams.

## üìäProject Breakdown
This project uses the AIMS grid project planning approach and follows a structured process of data collection, transformation, and visualization. The primary goal was to integrate data from various sources, including sales transactions, customers, markets, and products, into a unified reporting tool. Here are the core components of the dashboard:

- **Sales Performance Analysis**: Visualizes the sales amount, profit margins, and quantity of products sold across different markets and customer types.
- **Product Insights**: Provides detailed breakdowns by product type and market, helping identify best-sellers and areas for growth.
- **Time-based Trends**: Uses date dimensions to track sales performance over time, showing trends in sales amounts and profit margins by month, quarter, or year.
- **Interactive Features**: Users can filter the data based on various factors such as region, customer type, product type, and time period to get customized reports.

## üîçKey Features
- **Sales Trends**: A line chart shows sales performance over time, helping managers understand how sales fluctuate monthly, quarterly, or yearly.
- **Market Analysis**: A geographical map visualizes sales performance by region, providing valuable insights into which markets are performing well and which need attention.
- **Customer Insights**: The dashboard includes detailed customer data, allowing the sales team to segment by customer type and identify areas for improvement.
- **Profit Margin Analysis**: A measure of profit margins is calculated for each sale, helping the company evaluate the profitability of its products and services.

## üîçData Integration and Transformation
- The data was sourced from an internal **SQL database** containing transaction details, customer information, and market data. 
- The **ETL process** involved extracting the data, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into Power BI for visualization.
- **Power BI** was used to extract the data via DirectQuery, ensuring real-time analysis without affecting the source database. **SQL queries** were used to clean and transform the data before it was visualized in Power BI.

## üìàSuccess Criteria
- **Efficiency Gains**: This dashboard significantly reduces the manual work previously done in Excel, saving both time and cost for the sales and marketing teams.
- **Real-time Insights**: By automating the data collection and visualization process, the dashboard provides up-to-date insights on sales performance.
- **Cost Reduction**: One of the main goals of the project was to reduce costs associated with manual data processing and improve data quality.
- **Increase in Sales**: By leveraging data-driven decisions, the company aims to boost sales performance by identifying trends and areas for growth.

## Challenges Faced
One challenge was ensuring that the **SQL database** could handle complex queries without slowing down the operational systems. To solve this, we implemented **optimized queries** and focused on using Power BI's **data modeling** capabilities to minimize the impact on performance.

## üí°Future Improvements
- **Automation of Data Imports**: Future updates may include an automated ETL pipeline for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- **Additional Analytics**: Incorporating predictive analytics using Power BI‚Äôs advanced AI features to forecast future sales trends.

## üí°Key Achievements:
  - Reduced manual work previously performed in Excel.
  - Provided real-time insights, helping sales teams make data-driven decisions.
  - Streamlined the sales analysis process, saving time and operational costs.
