### **1. Top Merchants by Transaction Errors**

**Objective**: Identify merchants with the highest transaction errors and their error rates.  
**Query**:  
```sql
SELECT
    merchant_id,
    COUNT(transaction_id) AS total_transactions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_error IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_errors,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_error IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(transaction_id), 2) AS error_rate
FROM
    transactions_data_table
GROUP BY
    merchant_id
ORDER BY
    total_errors DESC, error_rate DESC
LIMIT 10;
