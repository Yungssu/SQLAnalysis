# 🚀 AuroraSQL Analysis Project

## 📜 Project Overview

The **AuroraSQL Analysis Project** is focused on performing **risk analysis** using **SQL queries** on datasets provided. The goal is to analyze various aspects of the business through data and generate insights related to **risk evaluation**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **AuroraSQL (Amazon Aurora)**: Database system used for querying and managing the data.
- **SQL**: Language used for querying, filtering, and aggregating the data to extract valuable insights.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for initial data exploration, cleaning, and visualization.

## 📊 Datasets

The following datasets are used in this analysis:

1. **cards_data.xlsx**: Contains information related to cards, such as card types, usage data, and customer demographics.
2. **[Additional Dataset Name]**: [Brief description of the dataset].

## 🏗️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Database Setup

- Set up an **Amazon Aurora database** to store and access the data.
- Ensure the database is properly configured to run **SQL queries**.

### 2. Data Import

- Import the **cards_data.xlsx** dataset (and any additional datasets) into **AuroraSQL**.
- Use the appropriate **SQL commands** (e.g., `LOAD DATA`, `INSERT INTO`) to populate the database.

### 3. Query Development

- Develop **SQL queries** to analyze the risk-related patterns within the data.
- Use `SELECT` statements to filter and aggregate data for detailed insights.

## 💻 Key SQL Queries

Here are examples of the SQL queries used in the analysis:

1. **Basic Risk Overview**:
   ```sql
   SELECT card_type, COUNT(*) AS total_cards, SUM(risk_factor) AS total_risk
   FROM cards_data
   GROUP BY card_type;

2. **Risk Factor by Demographics**:
   ```sql
SELECT age_group, AVG(risk_factor) AS avg_risk
FROM cards_data
GROUP BY age_group;
