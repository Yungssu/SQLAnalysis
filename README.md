## 📊 [Bank Churn Segmentation and Risk Insights](https://github.com/Yungssu/SQLAnalysis/tree/main/BankCHURNProject)

### Overview
This project investigates customer churn in a retail bank. By cleaning the raw data and writing SQL queries, I explored **who is most likely to leave** and **why**, revealing patterns across gender, geography, tenure, product usage, and customer activity.

### Highlights
- **Germany** had the highest churn rate at **32.47%**, twice that of France and Spain.
- **Females** were more likely to churn than males.
- Customers with **3 or more products** churned at rates of **80%+**.
- Built **risk segments** (High, Moderate, Low) using business rules on activity and product count.

### Skills Applied
- **MySQL**: data cleaning, joins, aggregations, CASE statements
- **Customer Segmentation**: tenure tiers, balance bands, product behavior
- **Insight Communication**: structured SQL-only findings for stakeholder use

## 🏢 [AuroraSQL Debt Analysis and Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Yungssu/SQLAnalysis/tree/main/AuroraRiskAnalysis)

### Overview
This project focused on analyzing customer financial data to group users by **debt levels** and **identify trends**. Using **SQL**, I categorized customers into debt brackets (No Debt, Low, Moderate, High, Very High Debt) and calculated the total debt, average debt, and customer count for each group. The results provided insights into how debt is distributed among customers and identified high-risk groups.

### Highlights
- **Debt Bracket Insights**: Found that most debt is concentrated in the "Very High Debt (>50K)" category, averaging $95,567. 👥
- **Customer Segmentation**: Organized data into clear categories to simplify analysis. 📊
- **Actionable Insights**: Data can guide financial decisions like loan approvals or credit risk management. 🔍

### Skills Applied
- **SQL Queries**
- **Data Organization**
- **Simplified Financial Analysis**
