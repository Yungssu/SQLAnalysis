## 🏢 [AuroraSQL Debt Analysis and Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Yungssu/SQLAnalysis/tree/main/AuroraRiskAnalysis)

### Overview
This project focused on analyzing customer financial data to group users by **debt levels** and **identify trends**. Using **SQL**, I categorized customers into debt brackets (No Debt, Low, Moderate, High, Very High Debt) and calculated the total debt, average debt, and customer count for each group. The results provided insights into how debt is distributed among customers and identified high-risk groups.

### Highlights
- **Debt Bracket Insights**: Found that most debt is concentrated in the "Very High Debt (>50K)" category, averaging $95,567.👥
- **Customer Segmentation**: Organized data into clear categories to simplify analysis. 📊  
- **Actionable Insights**: Data can guide financial decisions like loan approvals or credit risk management. 🔍

### Skills Applied
- **SQL Queries**
- **Data Organization**
- **Simplified Financial Analysis**
